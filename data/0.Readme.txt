Xx. PlantPat_DateMerge.dta: Between 1850 and 1885, a total of 4,563 patents were granted in the USPTO main class 112 (“sewing”).  From these data, we exclude patents for ancillary inventions, including “attachments” (subclasses 101 and 122 to 153) and “table and stands” (subclass 217).  Our final sample contains 3,508 patents issued between 1850 and 1885. We also compare our data with sewing machine patents in Knight’s (1877) Mechanical Dictionary. Knight includes 337 additional patents, but few of them are for improvements in sewing machines; 42 percent of Knight’s additional patents are for tables and stands, 26 percent are miscellaneous parts such as bobbin winders and tension devices.  To measure changes in invention in the absence of a pool, we construct a complementary data set of 1,493 British patents between 1850 and 1885 by searching A Cradle of Invention…for sewing machine patents.
	- `patent number`: patent number

	- `originator1`: Inventor name
